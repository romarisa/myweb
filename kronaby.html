This project involved the redesign of the Kronaby website to align with the parent brand, Festina, and its broader digital ecosystem.

While the original website was built using PrestaShop, we needed to update it to adhere to Festina's overarching structure, ensuring smoother management across the different brands within the group. A key reason for this unification was the challenge of making brand-specific updates — handling these changes individually for each brand would have been too time-consuming and inefficient.

                As a UX/UI designer on this project, my responsibilities covered a wide range of areas, including:<br>
                <ul> 
                    <li>
                    Research & Benchmarking: I conducted a thorough user research process, diving into analytics and speaking with real users to better understand their needs when browsing the site. This process also included benchmarking against competitors to identify best practices.<br><br>
                    </li>
                    <li> 
                    Design Aligned to the Brand: My design work was heavily informed by Kronaby's brand identity—its blend of classic elegance and modern innovation. I focused on ensuring that the website not only felt true to the Kronaby brand but also delivered a seamless user experience.<br><br>
                    </li>
                    <li> 
                    Wireframes & Prototyping: After gathering insights, I created wireframes and interactive prototypes using Figma, which allowed us to visualize and iterate on the design quickly.<br><br>
                    </li>
                    <li> 
                    Collaboration with Development: I worked closely with the development team, ensuring that all designs were feasible within our technical constraints. We used Storybook to streamline the development of reusable components, saving time and improving consistency across all devices (desktop, tablet, and mobile).<br><br>
                    </li>
                    <li> 
                    Handoff & QA: Finally, I facilitated a smooth design handoff to the development team and conducted QA testing, reviewing the site to ensure all design elements, paddings, and details were properly implemented.

                    <h4>1. Adherence to Bootstrap Guidelines</h4>
                    <p>A key aspect of this project was adhering to Bootstrap guidelines for consistency with Festina Group's overall digital strategy. The website design needed to reuse existing components from the parent brand's (Festina) structure to maintain consistency across the group’s brands. Due to time constraints and the need to align with future plans to redesign the entire platform using Tailwind CSS, our priority was to focus on basic but essential changes. Creating entirely new components would have been too time-intensive, so we prioritized reusability for efficiency. The components were built to function across desktop, mobile, and tablet formats, ensuring a versatile and responsive design.</p>

We conducted bi-weekly meetings to align on strategy, marketing goals, and design direction, allowing us to iterate effectively and ensure that every aspect of the project was on track.</p>

                    <p>The redesign of Kronaby's website began with a comprehensive user research phase:</p>
                    <ul> 
                        <li>
                        Preliminary research: Analyzing data from Google Analytics and heatmaps helped us identify navigation pain points and understand user behavior.<br><br>
                        </li>
                        <li> 
                        User interviews: Qualitative interviews with selected users provided insights into their expectations, helping us align the website with what mattered most to them.<br><br>
                        </li>
                        <li> 
                        Personas and scenarios: Based on these interviews, we developed user personas and scenarios to guide our design decisions.<br><br>
                        </li>
                        <li> 
                        Benchmarking: We benchmarked competitor websites, particularly in the premium watch and tech sectors, to gather ideas and ensure our ecommerce strategy was optimized for user engagement and conversion.<br><br>
                        </li>
                        <li> 
                        Ecommerce optimization: We streamlined the checkout process, optimized product page layouts, and improved overall navigation to reduce friction and enhance user satisfaction.
                        </li><br><br>
                        <li> 
                        Simplifying content structure: One major design improvement was simplifying the site’s typography and content hierarchy. The previous design had six different heading (<h>) styles, twelve subtitles, and five paragraph styles. I reduced these to four headings, four subtitles, and five paragraph styles, creating a more cohesive and readable experience without compromising on brand expression.
                        </li>

                        <li>
                        Hypothesis for V1: If we provide users with quick navigation on the homepage and expose high-value features, we can improve user engagement.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                        High-level problems & research findings: We found difficult navigation, unorganized content, and hidden tools as key challenges that negatively impacted the user experience.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                        Product goals: One of the main goals was to revitalize a site that was previously underperforming and inactive, generating minimal revenue.

                        <li>

The color scheme needed to reflect Kronaby’s premium, modern feel, so we used neutral tones combined with accent colors that spoke to the brand’s innovative side. Typography was chosen to be elegant yet readable, ensuring that it supported the overall aesthetic without overwhelming users.</p>
